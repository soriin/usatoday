Expects rabbitmq to be installed locally for communication between api and background-api

npm install in all three folders should install all deps

npm start in all three to get rolling (uses nodemon for apis)

tests in web and background-api run with npm test.
api is pretty much just a passthrough so any tests would have just been mocks calling mocks calling mocks.
